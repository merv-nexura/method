title: "PRD 055: Methodology Smoke Test Suite"
status: implemented

status_note: "Front-matter added 2026-05-31. Prose header claimed 'implemented', but PRD-056 reports master coverage was 0/17 methodology and 0/5 method features, so SC-1 ('every feature has a smoke test') was not met. Treat as implemented-with-gaps, not validated."

# PRD 055 — Methodology Smoke Test Suite

**Status:** implemented
**Date:** 2026-04-09
**Domains:** new `@methodts/smoke-test` (L4), consumes methodts, pacta, pacta-testkit
**Surfaces:** none (leaf consumer package)

---

## Problem

The methodology system has 35 feature categories across strategies, methodologies, and methods. Unit tests exist for individual components but there is no end-to-end smoke test that validates the full pipeline: YAML strategy definition, parse, execute, gates, artifacts, retro. DR-14 in the project card flags this as safety-net debt. The `tmp/demo-method-viz` prototype proved the concept but covers only 3 steps with zero verification.

## Constraints

- Must work offline with testkit mock providers (no real API calls) for CI
- Must support live mode with real Anthropic API for human verification
- Must not duplicate existing unit tests — smoke tests validate integration, not logic
- Playwright for automated runs; browser UI for human inspection
- New workspace package under `packages/smoke-test`

## Success Criteria

1. Every feature from the 35-category methodology inventory has at least one smoke test case
2. `npm run smoke` passes in CI without API keys (testkit mode)
3. Human can open the web app, browse all test cases by feature, and run them visually

## Scope

**IN:** Strategy DAG execution (all 5 node types), gate types (3 + strategy-level), artifact store versioning, sub-strategy invocation, oversight rules, retro generation, critical path, budget enforcement, output validation, scope contract, prompt construction, cycle detection, DAG validation, trigger system, token/cost tracking, execution state snapshots, refresh_context, method step sequences with pacta agents.

**OUT:** Registry YAML compilation (G0-G6 gates), cognitive composition operators (RFC-001 experiments), bridge HTTP route rendering (separate concern), cluster federation.

### Test case model

```typescript
interface SmokeTestCase {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: 'strategy' | 'method' | 'methodology';
  features: string[];
  fixture: string;
  mode: 'mock' | 'live' | 'both';
  expected: {
    status: 'completed' | 'failed' | 'suspended';
    nodeStatuses?: Record<string, string>;
    artifactsProduced?: string[];
    gatesPassed?: string[];
    gatesFailed?: string[];
    oversightTriggered?: boolean;
    retroGenerated?: boolean;
    costRange?: [number, number];
    errorContains?: string;
  };
}
```

### Web app

Three-panel layout:

1. **Sidebar** — Test case browser by category (Strategy / Method / Methodology). Feature tags as filter chips. Status indicators (pass/fail/not-run).
2. **Main panel** — Pipeline diagram, step-by-step execution with streaming, per-step metrics, gate results, artifact store inspector, oversight events log, retro viewer.
3. **Verification panel** — Expected vs actual assertions. Green/red indicators. Diff for mismatches.

## Phase Plan

### Wave 0 — Package scaffold + fixtures
- Create `packages/smoke-test/` with package.json, tsconfig, configs
- Write 25 strategy YAML fixtures
- Write 6 method step-sequence definitions
- Write test case registry with all 35 cases and expected outcomes
- Add to workspace

### Wave 1 — Mock executor + verification engine
- `mock-executor.ts` — wires testkit into DagStrategyExecutor
- `live-executor.ts` — wires real Anthropic provider
- `result-checker.ts` — validates results against expected outcomes
- `fixtures.test.ts` — all YAML fixtures parse correctly

### Wave 2 — Web app
- Enhanced `server.ts` — test case browser, run cases via SSE
- `index.html` + `styles.css` — three-panel UI
- Pipeline visualization, artifact inspector, gate results, retro viewer
- Verification panel with assertion results

### Wave 3 — Playwright tests + CI
- `smoke.spec.ts` — browser tests for each case
- CI integration: `npm run smoke` (mock mode, no API keys)
- Live mode: `npm run smoke:live` (real API for `both`/`live` cases)

### Acceptance Gates
- All 25 mock-mode cases pass without API keys
- Web app renders all cases with correct visualization
- Playwright suite runs in < 60 seconds (mock mode)
- Every row in the feature matrix has at least one passing test

## Risks

1. **Mock fidelity** — Testkit providers may diverge from real behavior. Mitigated by `both`-mode cases that also run against real API.
2. **YAML fixture drift** — Strategy format evolves. Mitigated by `fixtures.test.ts` failing on parse errors.
3. **Playwright timing** — SSE streaming + timing assertions. Mitigated by `waitFor` with generous timeouts and deterministic mock responses.
